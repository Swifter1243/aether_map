# What is this?

# Why is it here?

I am making the source of this map public so that others can study how it works. However, I still hold the rights to all of the assets created by me (which is 99% of them!).

I do not want my work being copy-pasted into other projects and potentially being profited off of. I would really rather that you use it transformatively or as a reference.

Please respect this!

# How can I support you?

Well since you asked, I do have a [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/swifter) where you can donate :)
